Q: When will the change take place?

A: Things are still currently being developed. However, it is predicted that the new site will go into operation in late August or early September of 2019.


Q: What will change on Visual Studio Education?

A: Videos, tutorials, software information, and tip information will no longer be presented on Facebook. Instead, it will be hosted on the new website in conjunction with our Azure DevOps repositories.


Q: How will this change affect current Facebook users who voted to like the page, and subscribe to notification from the page?

A: We are aware that most of the current user base for the page resides in countries other than the US and we are working with Microsoft on issues where users could be blocked. An update will be provided when we have more information.


Q: What is the reason for the change?

A: Overall, we are moving with the times and we think it’s time to produce a page of our own in which we can measure results, provide content, and grow in ways that we could not do on Facebook.


Q: What factors went into the decision of changing the format?

A: Our biggest factor was a recent poll which was taken. However, there were other contributing factors such as maintaining metrics, and the workflow of the forum. The poll data retrieved in combination with other data taken had the most weight in our decision making.


Q: What exactly will change in the forum?

A: Videos, tutorials, tips, updates, and new information about Visual Studio and related products will be announced on the new site and not the Facebook page. The Facebook page will remain as a presence where users can like us and receive general event information as well as message us. All, other functions will be transferred to the new site.


Q: What will happen to the older content, which is still on the Facebook page?

A: All older content is currently being review, including any videos which were recently presented. While the video currently on Facebook status is in limbo, all older content which is not currently up to date will be removed. All, other content which is up to date and falls into the category within the forum changes will be moved to the new site.

Q: Will a site login be required?
